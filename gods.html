                <div class="col">
                    <h4 id="Herakles">‚Äî Herakles üí™</h4>
                    <p>As he is the son of Zeus, he has a similar physique, portraying his strength and godly figure, as well as his attitude and temper. To better identify Herakles, he is also described seen with: ‚Äúa sword from Hermes, a bow and arrows from Apollo, a golden breastplate from Hephaestus, and a robe from Athena; for he had himself cut a club at Nemea‚Äù (Apollodorus <i>Bibliotheca</i> 2.4.11.17-19). As seen in Figure 6, Herakles carries the bow and arrows, and wears a robe. On his head, the head of an animal can be seen. This is the lion scalp that he wears as a helmet that he had killed once he was eighteen (Apollodorus <i>Bibliotheca</i> 2.4.10.5-6). The vase itself also has ‚ÄúHERAKLES‚Äù inscribed vertically behind him to indicate that it is him.</p>
                    <p>Observing this lekythos, Herakles is the first character (left-to-right) that can be seen. His back is turned to the rest of the characters as he sacrifices to Helios, not aware that night is turning to morning (Pinney et al., 1984, p. 141). From his travels, it is known that he receives help from Helios when he is given the golden goblet to travel across the ocean. By being near the ocean, Herakles would have access to fish (something commonly sacrificed), which he could sacrifice to the gods. In the vase, he is seen roasting ‚Äúsacrificial fatty shish kebabs over a flaming altar‚Äù to do so (Hurwit, 2017, p. 540). The ocean was also crucial to the Greek world as they believed that water surrounded them. Having Herakles go across these waters would prove how dedicated he is to become a hero (Evans, 2020, 12-13). In <i>Bibliotheca</i>, where Herakles' labors are explained, it is never mentioned that he sacrifices to the gods. This leaves the scene up for interpretation since there is no other texts that depict the story in this manner, and makes the vase loosely inspired by Herakles' labors.</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <h4 id="Dog">‚Äî Cerberus/Orthus üêï</h4>
                    <p>The next character observed is the dog that lays underneath Herakles in a cave like object (Fig 7). There is no concrete description for who this dog is or why he is on this vase, there are two theories on what it could be. While looking at Herakles' journey, he does encounter two different dogs.</p>
                    <p>The first one he meets is Orthus, a guard dog for the red cattle of Geryon, when he travels to the island of Erythia for his tenth labor. When he firsts lands on the island, he is not kindly greeted by Orthus as he runs at Herakles who in turn uses his club to kill the dog. However, he is described as a ‚Äútwo-headed hound‚Äù (Apollodorus <i>Bibliotheca</i> 2.5.10). The character on this vase only has one head as seen in Fig. 7. Perceiving this character as Orthus would seem to set this scene before Herakles arrives to Erythia and faces the dog.</p>
                    <p>The second dog that Herakles encounters on his journeys is Cerberus. Although, Cerberus is known to have ‚Äúthree heads of dogs, the tail of a dragon, and on his back the heads of all sorts of snakes‚Äù, it is obvious that the Sappho Painter did not depict the dog this way (Apollodorus <i>Bibliotheca</i> 2.5.12.1-2). Herakles' twelfth labor was to bring Cerberus from Hades. As the scene on the vase has the dog in some sort of cave structure, this could represent the entrance to the underworld where Cerberus resides. The gates of the house of Nyx and Hemera are also associated with the underworld as this is where the souls pass (Lazongas et al., p. 270). Given both options, this piece could be derived from a combination of visual and literary representations of this story that has been passed down through the years.

                    <h6>Fig 8. Nyx</h6>

                <div class="col">
                    <h4 id="Nyx">‚Äî Nyx üåë</h4>
                    <p>As a primordial god, Nyx (Night) is not too hard to identify. Her appearance is not overly described, but she is commonly described as ‚Äúwrapped in a vaporous cloud‚Äù (Hesiod <i>Homeric Hymns</i> 211). A common theme of terms that are generally perceived as bad or dark are also often used to describe her including: evil, murky and doom. Above her head, there is a dark cloud shape that replaces her being wrapped in the cloud itself. As previously mentioned, Herakles could be near the ocean, the chariots she rides could be emerging from the sea and is wrapped in waves. Since they both pull the sun and moon, these swirls could also be clouds as they travel through the sky (Hurwit, 2017, p. 540-541). In either case, she is making room for Helios.</p>
                    <p>The vase shows her in her chariot travelling left. This placement could represent the time of day. Using a cardinal system, West is the leftmost direction and is where the sun/moon sets while the other rises in the East. Since Nyx and Eos-Hemera represent the cycle of the day, they are never in the same place at once, ‚ÄúNight and Day draw near and greet one another as they pass the great threshold of bronze: and while the one is about to go down into the house, the other comes out at the door‚Äù (Hesiod <i>Homeric Hymns</i> 744). Both goddesses face away from each other as if they have just passed each other and it is now the morning when the sun will rise. In any of the labours described in Bibliotheca Nyx is never mentioned. Her presence in the cycle of the day and relation to Helios is most likely the reason she is found on this <i>lekythos</i>.</p>
                    <p>The point at which Night and Day meet is usually located at the end of the world where ‚Äúsouls are passing during their afterlife journey towards Hades' kingdom‚Äù (Lazongas, p. 270). This concept supports the idea that the dog that lays underneath Herakles could be Cerberus. Since Herakles goes to the underworld in his twelfth labor, this scene could be foreshadowing his journey there.</p>

                    <h4 id="Helios">‚Äî Helios ‚òÄÔ∏è</h4>
                    <p>When looking towards the middle of the vase, the word ‚ÄúHELIOS‚Äù can be spotted. Without having this statement, he could still be easily recognized. Helios is often described as having bright rays beaming from his head as well as locks that stream around his face or wearing a golden helmet. He also wears a fine garment that ‚Äúglows upon his body and flutters in the wind‚Äù (Hesiod <i>Homeric Hymns</i> 1). Rather than this depiction, he is shown with a ‚Äúrayed solar disk‚Äù replacing the beams directly from his head as seen in Figure 5 (Hurwit, 2017, p. 540). If one portrayal remains the same, it is that Helios is seen with his four horses that pull his chariot. He is often associated with having the four horses and chariot as it was him to be ‚Äúfirst among the gods [who] made use of the quadriga‚Äù (Pseudo-Hygenius <i>Astronomica</i> 2.13.1.2). Even if the chariot itself cannot be seen, the presence of the four horses supports the image.</p>
                    <p>Helios is also seen as a protector of all, as he was ‚Äúthe 'supervisor' of mortals and immortals alike, the deity revered by everyone, the one who watched and heard everything‚Äù (Grollios, 1984, p. 19). Since this vase is inspired by the tenth labor of Herakles, it makes sense to see Helios. Trying to get across the ocean, Helios gives Herakles the golden goblet so that he can travel to the island. By being the god who sees all, this would imply that he would have been able to observe Herakles in his journeys for the nine prior labors. In Bibliotheca, Helios gives the goblet after admiring his daring nature to point his bow at the Sun (Apollodorus <i>Bibliotheca</i> 2.5.10.7-9). He is also protecting Herakles by giving him a means to cross the ocean instead of letting him struggle, supporting Helios' character.</p>

                    <p>When the sun begins to finally rise after a long night, it is Eos (Dawn)‚Äîsister of Helios‚Äîwho rises. Often, Eos is also used interchangeably with Hemera (Day) who is the daughter of Nyx (Theoi.com, n.d., ‚ÄúEos‚Äù). As the other characters have their names inscribed on the vase, ‚ÄúH EOS‚Äù indicating that it could be either. They are both described similarly as they both ride in the chariot to pull the sun before Helios. Above her head there is a sun indicating that she is the rising sun and not the rising moon like Nyx. In most texts, Eos is seen at the start as she brings the day with her and is introduced as ‚Äúrosy-fingered goddess‚Äù and can be seen with her own pair of wings (Theoi.com, n.d., ‚ÄúEos‚Äù). The vase does not show any wings from the goddess herself, which may fit the description of Hemera better. As she was ‚Äúlargely irrelevant in mythology‚Äù (Theoi.com, n.d., ‚ÄúHemera‚Äù), there are no specific defining characteristics for her.</p>
                    <p>In the same context as Nyx, Eos-Hemera was also never explicitly mentioned in any of Herakles' labors. She supports the concept of time moving as she crosses paths with Nyx.</p>
